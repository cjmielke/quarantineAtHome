### Windows development

#### environment setup (how Cosmo does it at least)

* On a windows computer, install pycharm community
* When it starts, click "get from version control" and clone this git repository
	* if git for windows isn't installed, [get it here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-git-integration.html#)
* install python for windows : https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2717/
